# Mines-And-Dollars
  This console game was written in 2018. 
  At the beginning I wanted to make a snake (I couldn't make it so that the tail would also move behind the head, and from here and "Mines and Dollars" :)). The logic of the game is simple and primitive. You need to collect as many Dollars as possible and not fall into mines that the player himself puts after picking up a bag with a dollar in that cell.
  But I tried to make the Menu, etc. beautiful.
  If you look at the code, you can find two cheats (Find them).
  Cheats can be turned on during the game by clicking on ESC, writing the cheat itself and clicking on ENTER.
  Good luck!
